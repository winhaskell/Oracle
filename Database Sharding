What is Sharding or Data Partitioning?
Sharding (also known as Data Partitioning) is the process of splitting a large dataset into 
many small partitions which are placed on different machines. Each partition is known as a "shard".

Each shard has the same database schema as the original database. Most data is distributed such
that each row appears in exactly one shard. The combined data from all shards is the same as
the data from the original database.

When to use sharding ?
Use this pattern when a data store is likely to need to scale beyond the resources available to
a single storage node, or to improve performance by reducing contention in a data store.

For example, if you're designing the next Netflix, you'll need to store and provide low latency reads
to a huge number of video files. In this case you might want to shard by the genre of the movies. 
You'll also want to create replicas of the individual shards to provide high availability.

The primary focus of sharding is to improve the performance and scalability of a system, but as
a by-product it can also improve availability due to how the data is divided into separate partitions.
