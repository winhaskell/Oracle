We’re a cloud technology company that provides organizations around the world with computing infrastructure and software to help them innovate,
unlock efficiencies and become more effective. We also created the world’s first – and only – autonomous database to help organize and secure our customers’ data.

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure offers higher performance, security, and cost savings. It is designed so businesses can move workloads easily from 
on-premises systems to the cloud, and between cloud and on-premises and other clouds. Oracle Cloud applications provide business leaders with
modern applications that help them innovate, attain sustainable growth, and become more resilient.

The work we do is not only transforming the world of business--it's helping defend governments, and advance scientific and medical research. 
From nonprofits to companies of all sizes, millions of people use our tools to streamline supply chains, make HR more human, quickly pivot to a new financial plan, 
and connect data and people around the world.
